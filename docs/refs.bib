  abstract = {The mechanics of vapor bubble collapse under spherically symmetrical conditions is examined to ascertain the relative importance of the effects of liquid inertia and heat transfer on the collapse rate. A dimensionless parameter, Beff, is identified to characterize the mode of collapse. Discriminating values of this parameter are suggested for the simple case where the collapse is initiated by a step change in pressure or temperature. For heat transfer controlled collapse, a model is also proposed to account for the influence of a permanent gas present in the bubble. Experimental results for bubbles with initial radii ranging from 0.3 cm to 0.9 cm collapsing in water and ethyl alcohol at atmospheric pressure levels and under free fall conditions are presented. The pressure difference ranges from 12 cm Hg to 63 cm Hg and the corresponding degrees of subcooling are 5 deg C to 45 deg C. Data are also given for water vapor bubbles containing significant amounts of nitrogen, helium, and xenon. When compared with theory, reasonable agreements are obtained. For slowly collapsing bubbles, the significance of small translational velocities is brought to attention. Photographic evidences are also given for bubble instability under suitable conditions.}

  abstract = {Condensation of vapor bubbles in a subcooled liquid is known to influence heat transfer and pressure oscillation in subcooled boiling and direct contact condensation. This study reviews the published literature concerning interfacial heat transfer and bubble dynamics in the process of bubble condensation. The correlations for bubble condensation are analyzed and evaluated with a database covering a wide range of Reynolds, Jacob, and Prandtl numbers. Then, the investigations addressing bubble dynamics are reviewed, which focus on the bubble condensation patterns, motion, collapse, and the pressure oscillations induced by bubble condensation, as well as the effect of noncondensable gas and field. Despite the extensive experiments of bubble condensation available in the literature, it is shown that there is still a shortage of investigation focused on the variation of thermal boundary layer and turbulence formed near the bubble at the micro-scale, which could help to develop the prediction method of bubble condensation in the future. The transportation of noncondensable gas inside the mixture bubble and effect of capillary waves formed on the bubble surface on the actual vapor-liquid contact area and thermal boundary are also suggested to be further investigated to gain the thorough understanding of the bubble condensation process.},

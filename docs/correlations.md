# Correlations

The following correlations give the bubble history for direct contact condensation of vapor bubbles in a subcooled liquid {cite:p}`tangReviewDirectContact2022`. One such correlation considers a stagnant bubble in liquid dominated by heat transfer {cite:p}`florschuetzMechanicsVaporBubble1965`, which can be represented as

```{math}
\beta = 1 - 4Ja\sqrt\frac{Fo_0}{\pi}
```

Test.
